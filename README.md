# Scientific Computing with Python Certification

This repository contains examples that I worked through while studying for the Scientific Computing With Python certification at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/). My solutions to the independent projects are in the `challenges` directory.

Just adding these as and when at the moment but will add more and some extensions to the projects when I have time.
